# React Package Template
This is basic initial react component template, if you want to build a new react component that you or others can consume (`import`/`require`) via npm registery for example - you can build the component (inside `src`) and publish it to npm.


## How To Use
1. Install with `npm install my-component-name --save`.
2. Import to your "js" file: `import Input from 'my-component-name';`.
3. In your code, use like that: `<MyComponentName onChange={this.test}/>`.
4. See `example/basic.js` as reference.
